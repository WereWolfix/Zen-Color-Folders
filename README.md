# Zen Folder Color Picker

Adds a **"Change Color…"** item to the right-click menu on sidebar folders in
Zen Browser, opening a panel with three independent color wheels — **icon
fill**, **icon outline**, and **label text** — plus a decimal-capable
outline thickness control and a click-to-sample eyedropper (with a live
color-swatch + hex preview) on every wheel.


## Installing

This mod is built for **Sine** (a.k.a. Cosine, the in-development v2 of
Sine that adds broader Firefox-fork support) — the community mod manager for
Zen and other Firefox-based browsers.

1. Install Sine if you haven't already: https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine
2. In Zen, open Sine's settings page (it injects into the settings UI).
3. Use the "add an unpublished mod" field and point it at the folder/repo
   containing these three files (`theme.json`,
   `zen-folder-color-picker.uc.js`, `zen-folder-color-picker.css`) — e.g.
   push this folder to a GitHub repo and paste `you/your-repo`.
4. Sine will install the script and stylesheet and restart the browser UI.

You can also install manually via `fx-autoconfig` by dropping the `.uc.js`
file into your profile's `chrome/JS/` folder and the `.css` rules into
`chrome/userChrome.css`, if you'd rather not use Sine.
